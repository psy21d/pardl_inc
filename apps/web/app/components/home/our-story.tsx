            {t`Pardl INC was born from a simple observation: while breathing is fundamental to life, most of us don't breathe optimally. Our journey began when our founder, a former professional athlete, discovered the transformative power of proper breathing techniques during recovery from a career-ending injury.`}

          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
            {t`What started as a personal quest for better breathing evolved into a mission to make these powerful techniques accessible to everyone. We combined ancient wisdom with modern technology, creating a platform that makes breathing exercises not just effective, but engaging and personalized.`}
